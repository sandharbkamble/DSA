# Introduction to Graph | Types | Different Conventions Used
Graphs are two types:
1. Directed graph (Edges having directions)
2. UnDirected graph (Edges not having directions)

Graph contains Nodes/vertex and edges.

Circles represent Nodes and lines represent edges. 

An UnDirected graph has bi directional edges
and Directed graph can have uni or bi directional edges

u - v (UnDirected)
u->v & v->u

u -> v | v -> u (Directed)

* Binary trees can also be called as a graph

Cyclic - Start from a node and end at that node
Acyclic - Start from a node but doesnt reach that node

1. UnDirected Cyclic Graph
2. UnDirected Acyclic Graph
3. Directed Cyclic Graph
4. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Path - Graph containing nodes which are reachable
* Node cannot appear twice in a path

Degrees of a graph - No. of edges that comes and goes in a node
Example:
D(3) -> 2

* Property: Total Degree of a graph = (2 * E)

Indegree & Outdegree

Edge Weights - Weight of an edge
* By default, Edge Weight is 1
